HB-Cumulus is a Flash-based tag cloud for Habari that displays your tag cloud in a rotating sphere.

HB-Cumulus is a port of the brilliant WP-Cumulus (http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-cumulus/) by Roy Tanck (http://www.roytanck.com/).

FUNCTIONALITY
-------------

I've implemented all the functionality offered by WP-Cumulus 1.17 and a bit more.

Functionality includes the ability to set...

    * your own width and height
    * your own foreground, background (or transparent) and highlight colours
    * a rotation speed to suit your needs
    * the keywords to exclude
    * the number of keywords to display
    * the minimum and maximum font sizes to use

... all within the Habari plugin configuration options. There is even a preview of the cloud within the configuration section so you can see your changes taking effect as you save them.


INSTALLATION
------------

   1. Download either the zip or tar.bz2 to your server
   2. Extract the contents to a temporary location (not strictly necessary, but just being safe)
   3. Move the hb-cumulus directory to /path/to/your/habari/user/plugins/
   4. Refresh your plugins page, activate the plugin and configure it to suit your needs

That's it. You're ready to implement the cloud into your site.


USAGE
-----

There are two ways you can use HB-Cumulus:

   1. In ANY page or post:

      You can show the cloud in any page or post by putting the following code into the post/page content:

      <!-- hb-cumulus -->

      This tag is NOT case sensitive, so don't worry too much about the case or spacing. So long as you have all of the above characters in that order, it should display.

   2. In ANY theme file:

      You can show the cloud anywhere on your site within your theme files, for example in the sidebar using:

      $theme->hbcumulus();

      This IS case sensitive, so you'll need to be sure you get it 100% correct.


ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
----------------------

There are a couple of things worth noting for reference purposes:

    * Deactivating the plugin will delete your saved HB-Cumulus options, so you can always return to the default options by reactivating the plugin.
    * The following options are provided by default:
          o Width: 500px *
          o Height: 375px *
          o Tag Colour: #FFFFFF - to ensure reliable behaviour, HB-Cumulus will only accept 6 character HTML colours *
          o Second Colour: #FFFFFF (Optional) *
          o Highlight Colour: #FFFFFF (Optional) *
          o Background Colour: #333333 *
          o Speed: 100 - percentage *
          o Transparent: FALSE *
          o Distribute Tags Evenly: FALSE *
          o List of tags to hide: <not set> - this can be a space or comma separated list
          o Minimum Font Size: 8pt
          o Maximum Font Size: 25pt
          o Number of Tags to show: 30 - set to 0 or nothing to show all tags

      More information about the options marked with * can be found on the WP-Cumulus notes page.
    * Hb-Cumulus will work with Habari 0.5.2 and the latest SVN code.
    * Habari has no concept of categories at the moment, so it'll only show tags. If and when Habari gets categories, I'll update the plugin to support categories too.

That's it folks. If you encounter any problems, please feel free to leave a comment on the post that relates to the release.
